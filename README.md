OneName
=======

The decentralized identity system built on Bitcoin.

## Introduction

OneName is a decentralized identity system (DIS) with a user directory comprised of entries in a decentralized key-value store. OneName uses the Namecoin blockchain, but is compatible with any decentralized key-value store.

Users are added to the OneName directory via an entry into the key-value store, where the key is the username and the value is the profile.

The OneName protocol provides formatting specs for usernames and profiles and defines conventions for OneName crawlers/explorers (which read the profile data from the key-value store and display it online), as well as apps built on top of the network.

Nobody owns or controls OneName and users are in complete control of their data. OneName is open source, has a public design, and is for all to take part.
